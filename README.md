# GOTHAM Pendulum Lab — UI shell

This folder is the **new static-web architecture** for the GOTHAM pendulum demo.

It deliberately reuses the product architecture and visual language of the previous pendulum site — static GitHub Pages deployment, vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Canvas visualizations, responsive lab layouts, tabs, scroll progress, and local UI state — but **none of the previous GHAM/GOTHAM numerical engine is reused**.

## Current status

This version implements:

- the complete narrative page structure;
- guided sections for `q`, `M`, and `ħ`;
- the dark visual system and responsive layout;
- Canvas scaffolding with device-pixel-ratio handling;
- continuous `q` slider UX;
- integer `M` refinement UX;
- `ħ` convergence-control UX;
- tabbed workspaces;
- the `Scan ħ / Apply best` interaction shell;
- a fully unlocked Playground shell;
- GitHub Pages-ready static deployment.

It does **not** yet implement the validated frequency-corrected GOTHAM engine. All scientifically relevant plots that depend on the new solver are clearly marked as placeholders.

## Scientific target

The guided demo is frozen around

\[
\ddot x+\sin x=0,\qquad x(0)=1.5\ \mathrm{rad}\approx86^\circ,\qquad \dot x(0)=0,
\]

with continuous system transport

\[
\ddot x+(1-q)x+q\sin x=0,\qquad q\in[0,1].
\]

The new engine must preserve the conceptual separation:

- `q`: continuous system transport;
- `M`: integer truncation/refinement order;
- `ħ`: finite-order convergence control.

The frequency correction / time rescaling developed during validation must be part of the new engine.

## Expected browser engine API

`app.js` currently exposes an intentionally empty `Model` interface:

```js
Model.buildSeries({ amplitude, maxOrder })
Model.evaluate({ amplitude, q, M, hbar, duration })
Model.omega({ amplitude, q, M, hbar })
Model.exactPendulum({ amplitude, duration })
Model.metrics({ amplitude, q, M, hbar })
```

The next implementation step is to port the validated frequency-corrected GOTHAM formulation behind these functions.

## Run locally

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

## GitHub Pages

No build step is required.

1. Copy the files to the repository root.
2. Push `main`.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, deploy from `main` / root.

MathJax is loaded from a CDN. Everything else is local static content.

## Guided amplitude choice

The guided experience uses `A = 1.5 rad` (~86°): visually familiar (just below horizontal), while still clearly outside the small-angle regime. The Playground keeps `A = 2 rad` available as a harder case.

## v6 — Transport engine

The continuous `q` transport is now computed in-browser from the new frequency-corrected GOTHAM series for the guided `A=1.5 rad` case.

Connected views:
- operator `g_q(x)`;
- physical-time response `x(t;q)`;
- transported angular frequency `Omega(q)`;
- harmonic amplitudes H1 / H3 / H5.

Refinement (`M`) and convergence control (`hbar`) still remain intentionally disconnected until transport is cross-validated against the Python reference.


## v7
Transport now overlays q=0/current/q=1, and Spectrum uses H3/H1 and H5/H1 percentages with synchronized q/frequency/harmonic readout.

## v8 — richer Transport views
- Motion explicitly shows the conservative ±A turning-point amplitude and adds a lower temporal-deviation trace relative to q=0.
- Spectrum now shows the actual odd-harmonic line spectrum in physical angular frequency, with q=0 and q=1 references behind the current spectrum.
- H3/H1 and H5/H1 remain as compact nonlinear-distortion readouts.

## v9 — target refinement connected
At q=1 and baseline hbar=-1:
- exact pendulum reference is integrated in-browser;
- target GOTHAM approximation is evaluated for integer M;
- waveform + temporal error are drawn together;
- waveform NRMSE, operator residual, frequency error, and reliable horizon are live;
- convergence curves versus M are connected.
The q–M colormap and hbar engine remain for subsequent versions.

## v10 — q–M landscape
The q–M tab now computes a sampled validation view of the same continuous GOTHAM deformation.
- vertical axis: continuous transport coordinate q;
- horizontal axis: integer truncation order M;
- color: log10 waveform NRMSE against an independently integrated reference for the sampled q checkpoint;
- current refinement point at q=1 is marked explicitly.
The q samples are visualization/validation checkpoints, not separate GOTHAM runs.

## v11 — q–M performance
No scientific definitions changed.

- exact intermediate references cached once per q;
- q–M metrics cached once per (q,M);
- map computed progressively in requestAnimationFrame batches;
- changing M reuses the cached map;
- mobile uses a coarser display grid for responsiveness.

## v13 — isolated interaction state
Each page section now owns its own scientific controls. Transport q, Refinement M,
Control M/hbar, and Playground A/q/M/hbar can no longer overwrite one another.
This is an architecture fix; no scientific computation has been changed.

## v14 complete
q–M geometry is now its own section. All Control and Playground cards are live.
The browser uses the frequency-corrected q-series and finite-order generalized hbar weighting.

## v15 — visual review
Visual-only refinement pass:
- shared-pivot hero pendulum comparison with Δx(t) arc;
- restoring-law mismatch shading and release-point discrepancy;
- cleaner Transport motion hierarchy plus period-shift readout;
- physical spectrum shown in relative dB so nonlinear harmonics remain readable;
- q–M frontier emphasized with crosshair guides and explicit live interpretation;
- refinement convergence includes accuracy guides;
- M–hbar heatmap overlays best-hbar trajectory;
- Playground displays compact live Omega / waveform error / residual metrics.

## v16 — narrative redesign
The guided experience is now structured as:
Start Simple → Build a Path → Add Detail → Go Farther → Converge Better → Put It Together → Explore.

Mathematics is optional:
- local “Show the mathematics” disclosures in the relevant sections;
- a global Mathematical formulation drawer with target problem, homotopy operator, q-series, frequency correction, finite-order approximation, metrics, and hbar control.

The scientific engine is unchanged from v15.1.

## v17 — graduated mathematical layer
The global Mathematics drawer now has four depths:
Intuition → Formulation → Derivation → Computation.
It introduces the operator formulation, zero-order deformation equation, q-series,
frequency transport, higher-order deformation hierarchy, periodic solvability,
finite-order hbar control, and the diagnostics used by the browser.

## v19 — Playground rebuilt from stable v17
The Playground was rebuilt rather than patched.
Default/reset amplitude is now A=1.5 rad.
Every view uses the same Linear / Current / Ideal semantics, and the pendulum comparison uses one shared pivot.
Primary views: Motion, Operator, Frequency, Spectrum, Residual.
Diagnostics: Phase portrait, Error decomposition, Convergence, Energy.

## v19.1 — endpoint semantics
Playground visual references are now:
Linear = q=0, Current = selected (q,M,hbar), Target = exact q=1.
An Exact@q reference is retained internally only for local approximation diagnostics.
At q=0 the UI explicitly states CURRENT = LINEAR; at q=1 it states that CURRENT should converge toward TARGET with refinement.

## v19.2 — Linear semantics
The q=0 reference is now labelled Linear throughout the Playground.
Visible comparison: Linear (q=0) → Current (q,M,hbar) → Target (q=1).
Exact@q remains an internal/local diagnostic reference.

## v21 — verified visual pass
Built from v19.2 and verified before packaging:
- truly fixed/floating header;
- first Mathematics panel visibly reuses Linear / Current / Target colors;
- Mathematics opens at the level associated with the currently visible section;
- large narrative threshold “Enter the method” replaces the weak mid-page transition;
- v19.2 Linear q=0 and Playground A=1.5 defaults are preserved.

## v21.1 — startup/runtime correction
- normalized the header to a single stable id;
- app initialization no longer waits for MathJax;
- MathJax is asynchronous and optional for initial page rendering;
- fixed invalid scrollIntoView option;
- added a fail-safe so a JS exception cannot leave all reveal content invisible.

## v21.2 — synchronized Playground clock
The Playground pendulum and Motion chart now share the same animation clock.
While Motion is active and the Playground is visible, the chart redraws every animation frame
using the cached Linear / Current / Target trajectories. No GOTHAM solution is recomputed per frame.

## v21.3 — synchronized dynamic diagnostics
Motion, Operator and Residual now share the same Playground animation clock.
Operator shows instantaneous Linear / Current / Target positions on their restoring-law curves.
Residual shows a synchronized time cursor plus Linear / Current / zero-reference residual markers.
Cached trajectories are reused; no GOTHAM recomputation is performed per animation frame.

## v21.4 — visible Motion synchronization
Motion now has a visible playhead synchronized with the Playground pendulum:
- moving vertical time cursor;
- moving Linear / Current / Target markers;
- elapsed-time shading;
- live x(t) readout for all three trajectories.
The complete waveforms remain static by design; the instantaneous readout moves along them.

## v21.5 — Math color + diagnostic synchronization
- first Mathematics tab now colors equations inside MathJax itself, using the same Linear / Current / Target palette as the pendulums;
- Phase portrait, Error decomposition, and Energy are now time-synchronized with the Playground pendulum;
- Convergence remains intentionally static because its independent variable is M, not physical time.

## v21.6 — operator cleanup + exact first-panel colors
- removed vertical guides from Operator instantaneous markers;
- first Mathematics panel now uses only the two colors of the initial pendulum comparison:
  Linear = #f4ca5c, Target = #73d987;
- Current remains neutral in that first mathematical bridge because it is not yet the third visual state there.

## v21.7 — restore Current/error blue
Blue is restored as the auxiliary Current/error semantic in the first mathematical panel
and in the angular-gap cue, while Linear and Target keep their own pendulum colors.

## v22 — collapsible method journey
After Start Simple, visitors can now choose:
- Enter the method: expand the full guided sequence.
- Skip to Playground: jump directly to Explore while keeping the method hidden.
A small "Method hidden / Show explanation" bar lets visitors reopen the method later.

## v23
Visible +/− method accordion, no header amplitude chip, compact Playground,
and corrected first local MathJax comparison: nonlinear green vs linear small-angle gold.

## v23.1 — Playground state + MathJax color fix
- moving any Playground control now invalidates cached trajectories, rebuilds Linear/Current/Target,
  and restarts the shared clock at t=0;
- MathJax colors use rgb syntax instead of #hex, avoiding the macro-parameter '#' error.

## v23.2 — Playground height cleanup
Removed inherited minimum heights from the Playground containers so the card ends close to the visual content instead of leaving a large empty area underneath.

## v23.3 — Playground view isolation + defaults
Only one Playground canvas is visible at a time; changing tabs explicitly hides all others.
Initial/reset values: A=1.5 rad, q=0.5, M=7, hbar=-1.

## v23.4 — MathJax color render fix
Removed TeX color commands entirely. The nonlinear and linear equations are now plain MathJax
and receive green/gold through CSS on the rendered MathJax DOM, preventing "color..." text/errors.

## v23.5 — hero equation corrected
The MathJax formula directly beneath the two initial pendulums now labels the small-angle side
as "linear" instead of "easy". The complete linear expression is gold and the complete target
expression is green, matching the two pendulums exactly.

## v23.6 — layout fit pass
- added Fit Playground button to align the Playground just below the floating header;
- reduced initial pendulum hero height;
- reduced whitespace between header and Start Simple;
- removed purely decorative box borders/lines around PRIMARY and DIAGNOSTICS groups.

## v23.7 — compact layout and playback Fit control
- removed Explore;
- shortened copy and tightened vertical spacing;
- removed Playground minimum-height constraints;
- moved Fit beside Pause and t=0;
- Fit aligns the actual Playground workspace immediately below the floating header at 100% zoom.

## v24
- Show/Hide method added to header, immediately left of Mathematics;
- header forced to a single line;
- method charts redraw after hidden sections are expanded;
- Primary and Diagnostics Playground controls share one compact row;
- Playground visual height limited to 145 px;
- Fit uses the same style as t=0.

## v25 — conditional method nav + compact visuals/controls
- removed floating Method expanded banner;
- method-specific header links hide when the method is collapsed and reappear when expanded;
- guided chart heights reduced to 220px;
- q/M/hbar three-variable cards enlarged;
- Playground control deck compacted vertically.

## v25.1 — Refinement composition
On standard desktop screens, the Refinement `.workspace-canvas-stack.tall` is fixed to 400 px.
Surrounding controls, footer and Target fix are compacted so the chart remains the dominant element.
Medium laptops use 340 px; mobile uses 240 px.

## v25.2 — Playground cleanup
- removed Primary/Diagnostics labels;
- removed redundant A/q/M/hbar text from graph canvas;
- pendulum aligned to the right inside its card;
- graph column widened and canvas internal margins reduced to maximize plot area.

## v25.3 — unified guided chart sizing + larger Playground plot
Build a Path, Go Farther and Converge Better now use the exact same chart sizing
as Refinement: 400 px desktop, 340 px medium laptop, 240 px mobile.
The Playground graph column is wider, the pendulum column narrower, and plot margins/chrome are reduced.

## v25.4 — wider Playground pendulum
Increased the pendulum column by roughly 25% while keeping graph height and behavior unchanged.
